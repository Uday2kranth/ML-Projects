# Decision Tree with Gini Index

This notebook demonstrates how to build a Decision Tree classifier using the Gini Index as a splitting criterion.

## Features

-   Manual implementation logic
-   Explained step-by-step
-   Uses a small dataset for demonstration

## Goal

To understand how Gini Index works and how it affects decision tree splits.

## Concepts Covered

-   Gini Index
-   Entropy vs. Gini comparison (briefly)
-   Tree building logic

## Output

Displays the tree structure and prediction logic based on the Gini values.
