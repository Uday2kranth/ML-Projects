# Model Comparison: KNN, SVM, Logistic Regression

This notebook compares the performance of three common classification algorithms on the same dataset.

## Models Compared

-   K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
-   Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
-   Logistic Regression

## Evaluation

-   Accuracy scores
-   Confusion Matrix
-   Visualization of model predictions

## Objective

To understand how different models behave on the same data and evaluate their strengths/weaknesses.
